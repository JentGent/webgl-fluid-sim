# webgl-fluid-sim
Uses WebGL to numerically solve, in parallel, the Poisson pressure equation based on the divergence of the velocity field, which in turn gives a solution for the Navier-Stokes equations of incompressible flow (0 divergence).
Features velocity & color advection & diffusion and vorticity.
